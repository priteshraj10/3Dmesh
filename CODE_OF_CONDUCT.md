# 3DMesh Project Code of Conduct
To cultivate an inclusive and supportive environment, all contributors and maintainers commit to ensuring that participation in this project and its community remains free from harassment for everyone. This commitment is irrespective of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

##  Our Standards
Positive behavior that aids in fostering a welcoming environment includes:
Adopting inclusive language.
Respecting different perspectives and backgrounds.
Accepting feedback gracefully.
Prioritizing the community's collective well-being.
Demonstrating empathy for fellow members.
### Behavior we won't tolerate includes:
Utilization of sexualized language, imagery, or unsolicited sexual advances.
Trollish behavior, derogatory comments, or any form of personal or political assault.
Harassment, whether done publicly or privately.
Disclosing others' private data, like addresses (both physical and electronic), without clear consent.
Any action that is not suitable for the given context or setting.
All 3DMesh forums and spaces are designed for professional engagement. Any action that could be perceived as inappropriate in a professional context is strictly prohibited.

## Our Duties
Maintainers are tasked with ensuring that standards of acceptable behavior are clear. They are expected to initiate just and appropriate corrective measures in response to any misbehavior.

Maintainers hold the authority to delete, alter, or decline comments, commits, code, wiki modifications, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct. They can also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for actions deemed harmful, offensive, or disruptive.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct is applicable to all content on the 3DMesh official web platforms, its GitHub organization, and any other platforms that facilitate community interactions. This also extends to all official 3DMesh events, both online and offline.

Any representation of 3DMesh or its community, be it via official email, social media posts, or acting as a representative at events, falls under this Code of Conduct.

## Conflict Resolution
Disputes in open-source initiatives can vary greatly. Regardless of the intensity, we encourage individuals to first attempt to solve conflicts themselves, seeking assistance when needed. Direct escalations should be reserved for particularly severe incidents.

###  For any conflict:

Engage directly with the concerned parties, preferably in real-time.
If unresolved, involve a neutral third party familiar with the situation but not directly involved.
If the issue persists and you believe it's a violation of this Code of Conduct, please report it.

## Reporting Violations
If you observe any violations of this Code of Conduct, report them to the 3DMesh Project Stewards at priteshraj41@gmail.com. They will assess the situation, determine if there's been a breach of the Code of Conduct, and take necessary action, which may range from issuing a warning to expulsion from the project.

Only incidents that have occurred within the past year will be considered.

## Enforcement
Upon receiving a report, the Project Stewards will inform the accused about the report, offering them an opportunity for discussion before any action is taken. However, if the misconduct is ongoing or poses an immediate threat, sanctions may be imposed without prior notice.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org, and incorporates elements from the Geek Feminism Code of Conduct and the Drupal Code of Conduct.
